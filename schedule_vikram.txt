Project Schedule

# Work on getting access to Shyam's machine	[1]

# Get the dataset_all_full_460k.pkl file to your local  [1]

# Investigate what adsorbent hierarchy to work on as per Shyam's request - single metal, binary metal, ternary metal, etc [2]

# Select which adsorbates to include. [1]


# Clean the dataset to change the pKey from - ('bulk_mpid', 'miller_index', 'adsorption_site')  to  (only 'bulk_mpid', 'miller_index' ) and take only those rows with the lowest 'energy' such that 'adsorption_site' is no longer a pKey [5]

# Process the data and segregate the data for each adsorbate, and adsorbent pair. [5]
