Deliverables(16 hours)

1. Understand the correlation between adsorbents, adsorbates, energy and miller index.
2. Explore the data, understand the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Converting the pkl files data to dataframe.
4. Clean the dataset to change the pKey from - ('bulk_mpid', 'miller_index', 'adsorption_site')  to  (only 'bulk_mpid', 'miller_index' ) and take only those rows with the lowest 'energy' such that 'adsorption_site' is no longer a pKey [5]
5. Plan which visualizations to display, ideate a 3d visualization out of the data.
6. Start 2d visualizations from the data.
