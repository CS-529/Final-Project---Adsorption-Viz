Deliverables(16 hours)

1. Understand the correlation between adsorbents, adsorbates, energy and miller index.[2]
2. Explore the data, understand the dataset and preprocess it.[2]
3. Converting the pkl files data to dataframe and setting the indices for easy access.[2]
4. Clean the dataset to change the pKey from - ('bulk_mpid', 'miller_index', 'adsorption_site')  to  (only 'bulk_mpid', 'miller_index' ) and take only those rows with the lowest 'energy' such that 'adsorption_site' is no longer a pKey [3]
5. Plan which visualizations to display, ideate a 3d visualization out of the data.[3]
6. Start 2d visualizations from the data.[4]
